# Memory Game Project

Concentration game, also known as Match Match, Match Up, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs.

## Instructions

Clone the repo and run index.html in your favorite web browser.

## Dependencies

* jQuery 3.3.1
* Bootstrap 4.1.3
* font-awesome 5.5.0 icon font
* Animate.css
* Coda font

Dependencies are currently not included with the project, they are fetched from the internet.
Therefore, an internet connection is required to work.

## Developer decisions

* There was no need to include full-fledged timer library for current timer funcionality yet
* Bootstrap is currently used only for fancy modal window
* Basic flip animation is plain CSS transition, Animate.css is used for fancy match animation only

## TODO

* merge `open` and `show` classes together. It was in the template and it caused me more trouble than it's worth.
* then I can make a proper double sided cards with fully independent styling
